I would like to leave a short note about the website that i have designed for!
I chose fitness website among the choices 
my website represents about the fitness target  ( gym) 
i have designed this website on VS CODE with HTML and CSS  and no bootstrap or wordpress included
i have designed a working navigation bar with click to scroll function
i have included multiple hover effects tomake the website look premium
i have included <a href> tags to embed youtube links onto the catalouge
on clicking the catalouge it redirects the user to a youtube video where fitness activities can be practised
i have then included a feedback form to register users feedbacks
finally a contact us section for the user to stay connected in socialmedia

thank you!!
